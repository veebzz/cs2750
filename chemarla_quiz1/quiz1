My name is Vibhav Chemarla
I am junior at UMSL, and CMP SCI major
I have some background of Linux operating commands from St.louis
Community college -Meramec. 
I expect to have a good handle on all the subjects taught in this course
by the end of the semester.
I think we need to have more quizzes or time in class to try some of the commands
that we are being taught
